# Regularized-non-negative-MatrixFactorization
Optimizion in RegularizedΝon-negativeΜatrixFactorization. A feature engineering algorithm in multivariate analysis and linear algebra where a matrix V is factorized into (usually) two matrices W and H (i call it C), with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements.Also the factorization works better for sparse data than PCA.)

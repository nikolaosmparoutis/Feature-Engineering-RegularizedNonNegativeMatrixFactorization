# Regularized-non-negative-MatrixFactorization
Optimization in RegularizedΝon-negativeΜatrixFactorization. 
- A feature engineering algorithm reducing the number of features while retaining the basis information necessary to reconstruct the original data.
- A matrix V is factorized into (usually) two matrices W and H (i call it C), with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements (PCA does not do that).Also the factorization explains better the dimensions of sparse data than the Principal Component Analysis).
